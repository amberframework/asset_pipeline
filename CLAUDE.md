# Asset Pipeline

This is a front-end library written in pure Crystal that generates, manages and otherwise controls the front-end asset generation.

The following are all considered assets:

- CSS
- JavaScript
- Static files that are linked (ie: images, audio, video, etc.)
- HTMl Elements & the completed components that they assemble into for generating views.
